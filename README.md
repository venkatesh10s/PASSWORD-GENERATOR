# PASSWORD GENERATOR

This project is a simple **Password Generator application** built using **Core Java**. It was developed as part of my internship mini project submission. The goal of this project is to generate secure passwords with a random mix of characters, using basic Java programming concepts like strings, randomness, user input, and simple logic.

## Technologies Used

- Java (JDK 8 or above)
- Scanner for user input
- Random class for password generation
- Console-based (no GUI)

## Features

- User can choose password length
- Generates passwords using:
  - Uppercase letters (A-Z)
  - Lowercase letters (a-z)
  - Numbers (0-9)
  - Symbols (!, @, #, etc.)
- Ensures each password contains at least:
  - One uppercase letter
  - One lowercase letter
  - One digit
  - One symbol
- Shuffles the characters to improve randomness

## How to Run

javac *.java
java Main

## Sample Output

=== Password Generator ===
Enter desired password length: 10
Generated Password: $Y?mzSL6q(
